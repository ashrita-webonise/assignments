Steps to rebase our branches

Consider we have a branch feature1 which we have to rebase with develop.
	
	That is all the commits on develop branch have to be rebased onto feature1 branch.
doing it the other way around is a bad practice as it will raise a problem to other developers on other features.


so first get the changes from develop
git checkout fearute1 (ensure you are on your feature branch)
git rebase develop
git add <file/foldername>
git status (run this command regularly to track your activities)
git commit -m "write an appropriate message to caption the commit"
git push origin feature1
 (this command will push changes on remote feature1 branch)
now create a pull request to develop branch on github
